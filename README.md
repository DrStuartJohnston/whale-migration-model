# whale-migration-model

This repository contains the code to run the model described in "Avoidance, confusion or solitude? 
Modelling the impact of noise pollution on whale migration" by Johnston and Painter.

To run the code, download all Matlab scripts and folders and run "Homing_Script_WorldMap.m"

Note that this code requires that a lookup table for estimating the concentration parameter
in a von Mises distribution. This table can be download from:
https://melbourne.figshare.com/articles/dataset/kappaCDFLookupTable_mat/14551614

The parameter filenames to generate results for the specific figures in the manuscript
are described in "Homing_Script_World.m"
